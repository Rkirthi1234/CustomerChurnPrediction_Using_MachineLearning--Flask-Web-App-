# CustomerChurnPrediction_Using_MachineLearning--Flask-Web-App-

📝 Project Description:
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a customer will churn (leave a service) or stay, based on their attributes and service usage patterns. Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Flask, this project demonstrates how predictive modeling can be integrated into a user-friendly web interface.

The model is trained using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, and leverages a Random Forest Classifier with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance. It achieves a high accuracy score on the test set, making it a reliable solution for churn prediction in customer service industries such as telecom, banking, or subscription services.

💡 Features:
🧠 Machine Learning Model trained with oversampled data for better minority class prediction

🔍 Prediction of customer churn based on 19 key features

🌐 Simple and elegant Flask web interface

🧾 Clean UI styled with CSS

✅ Displays clear prediction results with supportive insights

🧪 Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn

Flask (Backend web framework)

HTML5 & CSS3 (Frontend)

Pickle (Model serialization)

🧠 Machine Learning Details:
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

Data Handling: One-Hot Encoding, Feature Engineering (e.g., Tenure binning)

Imbalanced Data Solution: SMOTE for synthetic data generation

Model Evaluation: Accuracy Score, Precision, Recall, F1-score

🚀 How it Works:
User enters customer-related details into the web form.

Flask app takes the inputs, processes them into a feature array.

The pre-trained model (loaded via Pickle) predicts whether the customer is likely to churn.

The result is displayed on the same web page with a message like:

"This customer is likely to churn."

"This customer is not likely to churn."
